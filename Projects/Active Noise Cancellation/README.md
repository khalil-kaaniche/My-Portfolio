Since I was working on the internal DSP library , I won't be able to share the source code so please find a PDF containing a summary of my work on the LMS algorithm implementation on STM32 .
After that I had the chance to work on :
- Integrating ARM CMSIS DSP library features to the internal library (FFT, Moving maximum, average, minimum, RMS, Standard deviation, Variance) 
- Implementing different audio effects : Delay, Compressor, Schroeder Reverbator based on All pass and Comb filter
- Development of an automated version of the Ziggler Nichols algorithm used for PID tuning
